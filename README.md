**Experimental application of Thorp-Kassouf option models to Bitcoin data**

Inspired by the empiricism of the original authors – who, in turn, were inspired by G. Polya’s plausible reasoning – this project explores applying the Thorp-Kassouf approach to model European options on Bitcoin (BTC).

## Features

- Build historical BTC price and options data.
- Modular modeling per instrument and global combined parameter approaches.
- Basic testing of model outputs.
- Focus on experimentation and reproducibility (WIP).

## Disclaimer

I am not a Python expert; the code could be optimized and better structured. This is mainly a playground for modeling ideas. Not for production use.

## Next Steps

- Explore strategies to anticipate when a contract will fit the model.
- Improve code structure and optimization.
- Extend testing and backtesting.
